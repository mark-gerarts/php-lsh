# Near-neighbour search using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), implemented in PHP

This implementation was created as a way to enhance my understanding of  LSH and 
mainly as something fun to do. I highly doubt this scales well.

## Locality-Sensitive Hashing: the theory

The implementation is based on the theory from 
[Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/), specifically 
[Chapter 3](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch3n.pdf). We will only go 
over the basic ideas here.

LSH consists of three steps:

1. Shingling
2. Minhashing
3. LSH

@todo

## Usage

Basic usage:

```php
<?php

use PhpLsh\LSH;

// `$inputs` can be any iterable of strings.
$inputs = [
    'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.',
    'Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.',
    'The five boxing wizards jump quickly.',
    'My girl wove six dozen plaid jackets before she quit.',
    'Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven jute bag.',
    'A wizardâ€™s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog.',
    'We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize.',
    'Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.',
    'The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog.'
];

// The defaults are explained later on.
$lsh = LSH::createWithDefaults();

// The return value is an array of tuples containing the indices of the
// candidate items.
$lsh->findCandidateItems($inputs);

foreach ($candidates as [$a, $b]) {
    echo sprintf('"%s" and "%s"', $inputs[$a], $inputs[$b]) . PHP_EOL;
}
```

Creating an instance of the LSH class can be configured as follows:

```php
// The LSH constructor. 
public function __construct(
    // Determines how the input strings are tokenized (shingled). By default
    // we use a character based tokenizer.
    private TokenizerInterface $tokenizer,
    // Creates minhash signatures based on the tokenized input strings. By
    // default an instance is used that creates signatures of length 100 and
    // uses a basic hashing algorithm.
    private MinHash $minHash,
    // Determines the hashing function that hashes bands to buckets
    // (string -> int). By default a basic naive implementation is used.
    private HashInterface $hash
) {}

// We provide a character based tokenizer and a word based one.
$characterTokenizer = new BasicCharacterTokenizer();
$characterTokenizer->tokenize("Hello", 2);
// Output: ["He", "el", "ll", "lo"]

// The word based tokenizer accepts a list of stopwords. Recommended:
// composer require voku/stop-words
// $stopWords = (new StopWords())->getStopWordsFromLanguage('en');
$wordTokenizer = new WordTokenizer(['list', 'of', 'stopwords']);
$wordTokenizer->tokenize("The quick brown fox", 2);
// Output: ["The quick", "quick brown", "brown fox"]

// Generating MinHash signatures of length 50. Basic hash functions are used,
// see PhpLsh\MinHash\BasicHash.
$minhash = MinHash::createBasicOfLength(50); 
// Customizing the hashfunctions. The number of hash functions equals the length
// of the signature.
$minhash = new MinHash([$hashFunction1, $hashFunction1, ...])

// Putting it together: let's create an instance that uses word tokenization
// and short minhash signatures:
$lsh = new LSH(
    new WordTokenizer(['the', 'a', 'an', 'and']),
    MinHash::createBasicOfLength(20),
    new BasicHash()
);
```

Usage:

```php
public function findCandidateItems(
    // An iterable list of strings. Can be a simple array, but usually a
    // generator.
    iterable $inputs,
    // The number of bands and rows to split the minhash signatures in. Keep in
    // mind that b.r=n is a hard requirement, with n being the minhash signature
    // length. 
    int $numberOfBands = 5,
    int $numberOfRows = 20,
    // How similar two items have to be in order to be considered candidates.
    // You should optimize t ~ (1/b)^(1/r) as explained in section 1.
    float $treshold = 0.8,
    // The shingle size used when tokenizing the input strings.
    int $shingleSize = 5,
): array;
```

## Example

Take a look at the [`example directory`](./example) to see how this library 
can be used to extract similar Wikipedia titles.

## Tests

Run the test suite:

```console
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
